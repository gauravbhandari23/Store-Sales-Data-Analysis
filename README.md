For the store sales data analysis, I used pivot tables and charts to visualize key performance metrics. The pivot tables allowed me to aggregate sales data by factors like product category, customer demographics, and geographical location. I then created charts to illustrate trends in sales volume and revenue, making it easier to identify the best-selling products, top-performing regions, and peak sales periods. These visualizations offered valuable insights into sales patterns, helping to inform strategic decisions for inventory management and marketing efforts.
